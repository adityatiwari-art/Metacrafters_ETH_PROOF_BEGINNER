# Metacrafters Ethereum Proof Beginner Course

## Description

This repository contains the code files and instructions for the Metacrafters Ethereum Proof Beginner Course. In this course, you will learn how to create a basic token on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity programming language.

The purpose of this course is to provide beginners with a hands-on experience in creating smart contracts on Ethereum, focusing specifically on token creation. By the end of this course, you will have a foundational understanding of Ethereum smart contract development and be able to create your own basic tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have a basic understanding of blockchain technology and some familiarity with programming concepts.

### Executing Program

To run the code examples provided in this course, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
3. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., create_a_token.sol).
4. Copy and paste the code provided in the `create_a_token.sol` file into the Remix editor.
5. Compile the code by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab and selecting the appropriate compiler version.
6. Deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
7. Interact with the deployed contract as instructed in the course materials.
